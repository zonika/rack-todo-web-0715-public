# But what about a more complex one?

class App

    Hi Ruby 003. It's #{Time.now}. 
    Hit refresh and realize you've been learning Ruby
    since #{(Time.now - seconds_in_25_days)}.
    How many days is that? 25? With weekends? And look what you're doing.
    Building a dynamic web application. I wonder what else you're capable of.
    TXT

    # And now instead of a static string in the body of the response,
    # we'll send our variable, response. And every request, it's value
    # will be different.

    [200, {'Content-Type' => 'text/html'}, [response]]

# Okay and now our Rack Handler to actually load the application
# on port 3001 of our computer.

Rack::Handler::WEBrick.run(App.new, {:Port => 3001})

# You should see the Rack output letting you know you have a server
# running, this time on port 3001.

# Open your browser again to http://localhost:3001

# And every time you hit refresh in your browser, you've been learning
# ruby for that much longer. Gives new meaning to this Sandi Metz quote.

# "You'll never be as stupid as you are right now."

# Hit refresh again, you've just gotten a few seconds smarter,
# a moment more familiar with Ruby.

# Okay, exit out of that server, shut it down with CTRL+C

# So we can put anything in that response? Hmm. I wonder what we can do...
